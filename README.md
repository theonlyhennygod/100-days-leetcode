# 💯 100 Days of LeetCode — Interview Prep Club

Welcome to the **Interview Prep Club's 100-Day LeetCode Challenge!**  
Our mission: build unstoppable consistency and problem-solving skills by solving **1 LeetCode problem every day for 100 days**.  
We'll track our progress publicly through GitHub commits to keep each other accountable.

## 🧭 The Goal

Solve **1 LeetCode problem every day** for **100 consecutive days**.  
By Day 100, you'll have:
- Sharpened your DSA fundamentals 🧠
- Strengthened consistency and focus 🔥
- Built a visible public record of growth on GitHub 📈

## 🗓️ How It Works

### 1. Fork or Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theonlyhennygod/100-days-leetcode.git
cd 100-days-leetcode
```

### 2. Create Your Folder
Inside the `submissions/` directory, make a folder with your GitHub username:
```
submissions/
└── your-github-username/
```

### 3. Add Your Daily Solution
Each day you solve a LeetCode problem, add your code here:
```
dayXX_problem-name.ext
```

**Examples:**
- `day01_two-sum.py`
- `day02_merge-intervals.java`
- `day10_longest-substring.cpp`

### 4. Commit and Push
```bash
git add submissions/your-github-username/dayXX_problem-name.ext
git commit -m "Day XX: Solved <Problem Name>"
git push
```

## 📜 Rules of the Challenge

✅ **One problem per day** for 100 days (minimum).  
🕐 **Commit daily** — consistency is key.  
🧑‍💻 Use **any programming language** you like.  
💬 (Optional) Add comments in your code to explain your thought process.  
🚫 **No copy-paste solutions** — always write your own.  
🔁 If you miss a day, you can catch up later — but try not to break your streak!  
💡 **Celebrate small wins** and help others when you can!
