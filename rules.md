# 📋 100 Days of LeetCode — Official Rules

This document outlines the official rules and expectations for the **100 Days of LeetCode Challenge**.

---

## ✅ Core Rules

### 1. **Daily Commitment**
- Solve **at least 1 LeetCode problem every day** for **100 consecutive days**.
- Your solution must be **committed to this repository** to count.

### 2. **Original Work Only**
- All code must be **written by you**.
- No copy-pasting solutions from LeetCode discussions, ChatGPT, or other sources.
- You may reference documentation and educational resources, but the implementation must be your own.

### 3. **Daily Git Commit**
- Each day's solution must be committed with a **clear message**:
  - Format: `Day XX: Solved <Problem Name>`
  - Example: `Day 12: Solved Binary Tree Level Order Traversal`

### 4. **File Naming Convention**
- Use the format: `dayXX_problem-name.ext`
  - `XX` = two-digit day number (01, 02, ..., 99)
  - `problem-name` = lowercase, hyphen-separated
  - `.ext` = file extension for your language
- Examples:
  - `day01_two-sum.py`
  - `day15_merge-k-sorted-lists.cpp`
  - `day42_lru-cache.java`

### 5. **Language Choice**
- Use **any programming language** you prefer.
- You may switch languages between problems, but consistency is encouraged.

### 6. **Folder Structure**
- All solutions must be placed in:
  ```
  submissions/<your-github-username>/
  ```
- Keep your folder organized and clean.

## 🔄 Flexibility and Catch-Up Policy

### Missing a Day
- Life happens! If you miss a day:
  - You may **catch up within 48 hours** and still maintain your streak.
  - Label catch-up commits clearly: `Day XX: Solved <Problem> (catch-up)`

### Streak Breaks
- If you break your streak (miss 2+ consecutive days without catching up):
  - You're still welcome to continue! Just reset your count and keep going.
  - Consistency is the goal, not perfection.

## 💬 Code Quality Guidelines

### Readable Code
- Use **meaningful variable names**.
- Add **comments** to explain your approach (optional but encouraged).
- Format your code properly (use linters if available).

### Problem Difficulty
- No restrictions on difficulty (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
- **Progression is encouraged**: start with easier problems and gradually tackle harder ones.

### Time and Space Complexity
- (Optional) Include a comment at the top of your file with:
  - Time complexity: `O(...)`
  - Space complexity: `O(...)`

**Example:**
```python
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(1)

def two_sum(nums, target):
    # implementation here
```

## 🚫 What's NOT Allowed

❌ Copying solutions from LeetCode discussions or forums  
❌ Using AI to generate the entire solution without understanding it  
❌ Committing fake or empty files just to maintain a streak  
❌ Submitting the same problem multiple times to inflate your count  

---

## 🏆 Completion and Recognition

### Upon Finishing 100 Days
- You'll have a **public portfolio** of 100+ solved problems.
- You'll be recognized in the repo's **Hall of Fame** (coming soon).
- Share your achievement on LinkedIn, Twitter, or wherever you celebrate wins!

---

## 🙌 Community Standards

- **Be supportive**: Encourage others and share insights.
- **Be respectful**: Everyone is at a different skill level.
- **Collaborate**: You can discuss approaches, but don't share direct solutions.
- **Ask questions**: If you're stuck, explain what you've tried and ask for guidance.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Enforcement

These rules are based on the **honor system**. We trust you to:
- Challenge yourself honestly.
- Learn and grow through the process.
- Build discipline and consistency.

If patterns of rule-breaking are noticed, maintainers reserve the right to:
- Request clarification on commits.
- Remove submissions that violate the rules.
